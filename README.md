This was just a test to see if i could link visual studio to github.

Hi I'm the Dyslexic Programmer.
I'm not really a programmer, I am a retired horticulturist.
iv only played with C++ and found it very interesting
so now I have lots of time to try and learn this stuff.
my aim is to go from all but zero to games engine using Opengl.
follow along and watch me make a complete fool of myself.
